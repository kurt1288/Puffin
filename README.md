# Skookum
<b><i>Chinook Jargon, meaning "strong" or "powerful"</i></b>

Skookum is a UCI-compatible chess engine written in C#.

## Installation

Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/kurt1288/Skookum/releases/latest). Please note, a CPU supporting BMI sets is required.
If you're not sure if your computer is supported, you can still try to run the engine. It will simply fail to run if not supported.

## Usage

Skookum is just the "brain" and does not provide any sort of user interface (except the command line). Popular free GUI programs are:

* [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess)
* [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
* [Banksia GUI](https://banksiagui.com/)

Follow the instructions for the GUI on how to add a new engine.
